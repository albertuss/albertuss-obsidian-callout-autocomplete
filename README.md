# Obsidian Callout Autocomplete Plugin

This plugin enhances your Obsidian experience by providing an autocomplete dropdown for callout types when you type `> [!`. It supports both default Obsidian callouts (e.g., `note`, `info`, `warning`) and custom callouts defined via the **Callout Manager** plugin. The dropdown displays callout names with their corresponding icons and colors, styled similarly to the **Admonition** plugin.

## Features
- **Autocomplete for Callouts**: Start typing `> [!` to see a dropdown with all available callout types.
- **Support for Default and Custom Callouts**: Includes standard Obsidian callouts and custom ones from Callout Manager.
- **Icons and Colors**: Each callout type in the dropdown is displayed with its icon and color, matching the callout's appearance.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically updates the list of callouts when you add or modify custom callouts in Callout Manager, without needing to restart Obsidian.
- **Styled Dropdown**: The dropdown is styled to match the look and feel of the Admonition plugin, with customizable sizes and spacing.
